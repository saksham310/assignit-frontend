# AssignIT Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for **AssignIT**, a full-featured project management tool developed as part of my Final Year Project (FYP). AssignIT provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to manage tasks, track sprints, and facilitate team collaboration efficiently.

The frontend is built using **React**, with **Zustand** for state management, **TanStack Query** for efficient data fetching and caching, and **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, responsive design. The project emphasizes scalability, performance optimization, and adherence to design system principles.

## Key Features

- Workspace and project-based task organization  
- Multi-sprint support and task assignment  
- Role-based access control (Project Manager, Developer, QA)  
- Bug tracking and retrospective feedback modules  
- OTP-authenticated login/signup flow  
- Detailed dashboards for project insights and progress tracking

This frontend was developed to improve team productivity and streamline project workflows, reflecting best practices in modern React development.
